# Read This to Me 

This is a personal project that leverages the SpeechSynthesis Web API to transcribe text into audio, making it possible for users to listen to their written content. This application can be used to have a long-form article read to you or to listen to your notes.

I built this project using simple HTML/CSS/JS â€” No larger web frameworks involved.
